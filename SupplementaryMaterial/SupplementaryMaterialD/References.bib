	abstract = {When using optoelectronic stereophotogrammetry, skin deformation and displacement causes marker movement with respect to the underlying bone. This movement represents an artifact, which affects the estimation of the skeletal system kinematics, and is regarded as the most critical source of error in human movement analysis. A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art for assessment, minimization and compensation of the soft tissue artifact (STA) is provided. It has been shown that STA is greater than the instrumental error associated with stereophotogrammetry, has a frequency content similar to the actual bone movement, is task dependent and not reproducible among subjects and, of lower limb segments, is greatest at the thigh. It has been shown that in in vivo experiments only motion about the ﬂexion/extension axis of the hip, knees and ankles can be determined reliably. Motion about other axes at those joints should be regarded with much more caution as this artifact produces spurious effects with magnitudes comparable to the amount of motion actually occurring in those joints. Techniques designed to minimize the contribution of and compensate for the effects of this artifact can be divided up into those which model the skin surface and those which include joint motion constraints. Despite the numerous solutions proposed, the objective of reliable estimation of 3D skeletal system kinematics using skin markers has not yet been satisfactorily achieved and greatly limits the contribution of human movement analysis to clinical practice and biomechanical research. For STA to be compensated for effectively, it is here suggested that either its subject-speciﬁc pattern is assessed by ad hoc exercises or it is characterized from a large series of measurements on different subject populations. Alternatively, inclusion of joint constraints into a more general STA minimization approach may provide an acceptable solution. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Insights on how such errors propagate to kinematic quantities are of great interest in the ﬁeld of human movement analysis to improve the precision and reliability of measurements. The review focuses on the technical assessment and analytical compensation procedures to cope with instrumental errors. Relevant contributions dealing with intrinsic sources of systematic and random errors, such as the issues concerning camera calibration and ﬁltering and smoothing of marker position data, are presented. Procedures for marker imaged processing, and missing marker recovery are also surveyed. Methods for checking the accuracy and precision of stereophotogrammetric systems are then reviewed. Finally, since the desired outcome of the movement measurements is a reliable estimate of body segment kinematics, state-of-the-art techniques proposed for minimization of error propagation arising from a cluster of external markers are described.},

	abstract = {Objective: Sport research often requires human motion capture of an athlete. It can, however, be labour-intensive and difficult to select the right system, while manufacturers report on specifications which are determined in set-ups that largely differ from sport research in terms of volume, environment and motion. The aim of this review is to assist researchers in the selection of a suitable motion capture system for their experimental set-up for sport applications. An open online platform is initiated, to support (sport)researchers in the selection of a system and to enable them to contribute and update the overview. Design: systematic review; Method: Electronic searches in Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were performed, and the reference lists of the screened articles were scrutinised to determine human motion capture systems used in academically published studies on sport analysis. Results: An overview of 17 human motion capture systems is provided, reporting the general specifications given by the manufacturer (weight and size of the sensors, maximum capture volume, environmental feasibilities), and calibration specifications as determined in peer-reviewed studies. The accuracy of each system is plotted against the measurement range. Conclusion: The overview and chart can assist researchers in the selection of a suitable measurement system. To increase the robustness of the database and to keep up with technological developments, we encourage researchers to perform an accuracy test prior to their experiment and to add to the chart and the system overview (online, open access).},

	abstract = {The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods deﬁned on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis–Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efﬁcient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain.The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efﬁcient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/ research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

	abstract = {A variety of inverse kinematics (IK) algorithms exist for estimating postures and displacements from a set of noisy marker positions, typically aiming to minimize IK errors by distributing errors amongst all markers in a least-squares (LS) sense. This paper describes how Bayesian inference can contrastingly be used to maximize the probability that a given stochastic kinematic model would produce the observed marker positions. We developed Bayesian IK for two planar IK applications: (1) kinematic chain posture estimates using an explicit forward kinematics model, and (2) rigid body rotation estimates using implicit kinematic modeling through marker displacements. We then tested and compared Bayesian IK results to LS results in Monte Carlo simulations in which random marker error was introduced using Gaussian noise amplitudes ranging uniformly between 0.2 mm and 2.0 mm. Results showed that Bayesian IK was more accurate than LS-IK in over 92\% of simulations, with the exception of one center-of-rotation coordinate planar rotation, for which Bayesian IK was more accurate in only 68\% of simulations. Moreover, while LS errors increased with marker noise, Bayesian errors were comparatively unaffected by noise amplitude. Nevertheless, whereas the LS solutions required average computational durations of less than 0.5 s, average Bayesian IK durations ranged from 11.6 s for planar rotation to over 2000 s for kinematic chain postures. These results suggest that Bayesian IK can yield order-of-magnitude IK improvements for simple planar IK, but also that its computational demands may make it impractical for some applications.},

Data were categorized by gait type and split into a training set (\$30\%) and a validation set (\$70\%). A principal component analysis was performed, and separate linear models were trained and validated for foot strike and toe-off, using ground reaction force data as a gold-standard for event timing. Results indicate the model predicted both foot strike and toe-off timing to within 20 ms of the gold-standard for more than 95\% of cases in walking and running gaits.

Recently, the application of principal component analysis (PCA) to gait data has shown promise in detecting important biomechanical features. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to deﬁne a new foot strike detection method for a continuum of striking techniques, by applying PCA to joint angle waveforms. In accordance with Newtonian mechanics, it was hypothesized that transient features in the sagittal-plane accelerations of the lower extremity would be linked with the impulsive application of force to the foot at foot strike. Kinematic and kinetic data from treadmill running were selected for 154 subjects, from a database of gait biomechanics. Ankle, knee and hip sagittal plane angular acceleration kinematic curves were chained together to form a row input to a PCA matrix. A linear polynomial was calculated based on PCA scores, and a 10-fold cross-validation was performed to evaluate prediction accuracy against goldstandard foot strike as determined by a 10 N rise in the vertical ground reaction force. Results show 89–94\% of all predicted foot strikes were within 4 frames (20 ms) of the gold standard with the largest error being 28 ms. It is concluded that this new foot strike detection is an improvement on existing methods and can be applied regardless of whether the runner exhibits a rearfoot, midfoot, or forefoot strike pattern.},

The two models are: (1) A rotational joint with a "xed axis of rotation, also referred to as a hinge joint and (2) a ball and socket model, corresponding to a spherical joint. Given the motion of a set of markers, it is shown how the parameters can be estimated, utilizing the whole data set. The parameters are estimated from motion data by minimizing two objective functions. The method does not assume a rigid body motion, but only that each marker rotates around the same "xed axis of rotation or center of rotation. Simulation results indicate that in situations where the rigid body assumption is valid and when measurement noise is present, the proposed method is inferior to methods that utilize the rigid body assumption. However, when there are large skin movement artefacts, simulation results show the proposed method to be more robust. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We propose a new method of sample size estimation for Bland–Altman agreement assessment. According to the Bland–Altman method, the conclusion on agreement is made based on the width of the conﬁdence interval for LOAs (limits of agreement) in comparison to predeﬁned clinical agreement limit. Under the theory of statistical inference, the formulae of sample size estimation are derived, which depended on the pre-determined level of α, β, the mean and the standard deviation of diﬀerences between two measurements, and the predeﬁned limits. With this new method, the sample sizes are calculated under diﬀerent parameter settings which occur frequently in method comparison studies, and Monte-Carlo simulation is used to obtain the corresponding powers. The results of Monte-Carlo simulation showed that the achieved powers could coincide with the pre-determined level of powers, thus validating the correctness of the method. The method of sample size estimation can be applied in the Bland–Altman method to assess agreement between two methods of measurement.},

It can, however, be labour-intensive and difficult to select the right system, while manufacturers report on specifications which are determined in set-ups that largely differ from sport research in terms of volume, environment and motion. The aim of this review is to assist researchers in the selection of a suitable motion capture system for their experimental set-up for sport applications. An open online platform is initiated, to support (sport)researchers in the selection of a system and to enable them to contribute and update the overview. Design: systematic review; Method: Electronic searches in Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were performed, and the reference lists of the screened articles were scrutinised to determine human motion capture systems used in academically published studies on sport analysis. Results: An overview of 17 human motion capture systems is provided, reporting the general specifications given by the manufacturer (weight and size of the sensors, maximum capture volume, environmental feasibilities), and calibration specifications as determined in peer-reviewed studies. The accuracy of each system is plotted against the measurement range. Conclusion: The overview and chart can assist researchers in the selection of a suitable measurement system. To increase the robustness of the database and to keep up with technological developments, we encourage researchers to perform an accuracy test prior to their experiment and to add to the chart and the system overview (online, open access).},

We show how to deal with issues arising from the topology of the Stiefel manifold and how to inexpensively compute the change-of-measure terms. We introduce an auxiliary parameter approach that limits the impact of topological issues. We provide both analysis of our methods and numerical examples demonstrating the eﬀectiveness of the approach. We also discuss how our Givens representation can be used to deﬁne general classes of distributions over the space of orthogonal matrices. We then give demonstrations on several examples showing how the Givens approach performs in practice in comparison with other methods.},

	abstract = {Widespread use of gait or motion analysis in the diagnosis of patients with locomotor pathology and the subsequent planning and assessment of treatment has been limited because of its reliability, particularly in evaluating frontal and transverse plane components. This is because spatial reconstruction of the musculoskeletal system and calculation of its kinematics and kinetics via a skin marker-based multi-link model are subject to marker skin movement artefacts. Traditional methods treat each body segment separately without imposing joint constraints, resulting in apparent dislocations at joints predominantly because of skin movement artefacts. An optimisation method for the determination of the positions and orientations of multi-link musculoskeletal models from marker co-ordinates is presented. It is based on the minimisation of the weighted sum of squared distances between measured and model-determined marker positions. The model imposes joint constraints. Numerical experiments were performed to show that the new method is capable of eliminating joint dislocations and giving more accurate model position and orientation estimations. It is suggested that, with joint constraints and a global error compensation scheme, the eﬀects of measurement errors on the reconstruction of the musculoskeletal system and subsequent mechanical analyses can be reduced globally. The proposed method minimises errors in axial rotation and ab/adduction at the joints and may extend the applicability of gait analysis to clinical problems. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The problem is formulated in a probabilistic framework so as to handle multiple and unavoidable sources of uncertainty: sensor noise, soft tissue deformation and marker slip, inaccurate marker placement and limb measurement, and missing data due to occlusions. All unknown quantities are treated as state variables even though some of them are constant. In this way, state estimation and system identiﬁcation can be performed simultaneously, obtaining not only the most likely values but also the conﬁdence intervals of the joint angles, skeletal parameters, and marker positions and orientations relative to the limb segments. The inference method is a Gauss–Newton generalization of the extended Kalman ﬁlter. It is adapted to the kinematic domain by expressing spatial rotations via quaternions and computing the sensor residuals and their Jacobians analytically. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a reliable data analysis tool used in practice. The software implementation is available online.},

A 3 Â 3 rotation characterizes the relative orientation of one body segment with respect to another. Replicates are available since each subject drilled at the same location ®ve times. Upper limb postures for the six drilling locations are compared by one-way analysisof-variance tests for rotations. These tests rely on tangent space approximations at the estimated modal rotation of the sample. A parameterization of rotations in terms of unit quaternions simpli®es the computations. The analysis detects signi®cant differences in posture between all pairs of drilling locations. The smallest changes, less than 108 at all joints, are obtained for the kinematically equivalent pairs of locations.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether prescribing joint co-ordinates during the marker registration process (within the modelling framework OpenSim) will improve IK derived elbow kinematics during an overhead sporting task. To test this, the upper limb kinematics of eight cricket bowlers were recorded during two testing sessions, with a different tester each session. The bowling trials were IK modelled twice: once with an upper limb musculoskeletal model prepared with prescribed participant speciﬁc co-ordinates during marker registration – MRPC – and once with the same model prepared without prescribed co-ordinates – MR; and by an established direct kinematic (DK) upper limb model. Whilst both skeletal model preparations had strong inter-tester repeatability (MR: Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM1D)¼0\% different; MRPC: SPM1D¼0\% different), when compared with DK model elbow FE waveform estimates, IK estimates using the MRPC model (RMSD¼5.272.0°, SPM1D¼68\% different) were in closer agreement than the estimates from the MR model (RMSD¼44.5718.5°, SPM1D¼100\% different). Results show that prescribing participant speciﬁc joint co-ordinates during the marker registration phase of model preparation increases the accuracy and repeatability of IK solutions when modelling overhead sporting tasks in OpenSim.},

This method is compared with other methods that use similar assumptions in the cases of random measurement errors, systematic skin movements and skin movements with random measurement noise. Simulation results indicate that the new method is superior in terms of the algorithm used, the closure of the solution, consistency and minimal manual parameter adjustment. The method can also be adapted to joints with translational movements. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Joint centers and axes of rotation (joint parameters) are central to all branches of movement analysis. In gait analysis, the standard protocol used to determine hip and knee joint parameters is prone to errors arising from palpation, anthropometric regression equations, and misplaced alignment devices. Several alternative methods have been proposed, but to date none have been shown to be accurate and reliable enough for use in the clinical setting. This article describes a new method for joint parameter estimation. The new method can be summarized as follows: (i) the motions of two adjacent segments spanning a single joint are tracked, (ii) the axis of rotation between every pair of observed segment conﬁgurations is computed, (iii) the most likely intersection of all axes (effective joint center) and most likely orientation of the axes (effective joint axis) is found. Initial validation of the method was conducted on a hinged mechanical analog and a single healthy adult subject. For the analog, the center was found to be within 3.8 mm of the geometric center and 2.0  of the geometric axis (standard deviation). For the adult subject, hip centers varied on the order of 1–3 mm, knee centers by 3–9 mm, and knee axes by 2.0 . The results suggest that the new method is an objective, precise, and practical alternative to the standard clinical approach.},

Rotation matrices are given for changing the orientations of the two Cartesian coordinate systems in such a way that the quadratic variations in the varus–valgus and in the external–internal angles are minimal. These estimated rotation matrices are used to correct for axis misalignment. The correction is calibrated by considering the impact of the new orientation of the thigh Cartesian coordinate system on the hip joint angles. The procedure is applied to kinematic data collected on normal subjects. The uncertainty about the speciﬁcation of the thigh Cartesian coordinate system is shown to explain some of the between subject variability in the varus–valgus and in the internal–external rotation angles curves.},

	abstract = {Movement of an object in three dimensions involves rotation and translation. The data for analysis are the coordinates of landmarks on the object, recorded at several time points. Statistical models for describing the rotational component of the movement of an object are proposed in this work. Under the fixed-axis model, the object rotates around an axis that does not change in time. The angular position of the object is then characterised by its rotation axis and an angle giving the extent of the rotation of the object with respect to a reference point. More complicated models occur when the rotation axis varies in time. Under the fixed-angle model the quaternions for the time-varying orientations of the object are shown to lie in a two-dimensional great circle on the surface of the unit sphere in four dimensions. Simple estimators are given of the comnmon rotation axis and of the angles characterising the time varying orientation of the object. A score statistic for testing the fit of the fixed-axis model is constructed and methods for handling the autocorrelation of the errors at neighbouring data points are provided. The analysis of data, collected by an OPTOTRACK camera system on a rotating forearm, illustrates the methodology presented in this paper.},

These include the evaluation of reachable positions and orientations at the distal end of a robot manipulator arm. A natural inverse problem arises when one wishes to design rather than to model manipulators. Namely, by considering a serial-chain robot arm as a concatenation of segments, we examine how statistics of known segments can be used to select, or design, the remainder of the structure so as to attain the desired statistical properties of the whole structure. This is then a deconvolution density estimation problem for the Euclidean motion group. We prove several results about the convergence of these deconvolution estimators to the true underlying density under certain smoothness assumptions. A practical implementation to the design of planar robot arms is demonstrated.},

The sample space SE( p) contains objects M = (R, t) where R is a p × p rotation matrix and t is a p × 1 translation vector. This work is motivated by applications in biomechanics where the posture of a joint at a given time is expressed as M ∈ SE(3), the rigid body displacement needed to map a system of axes on one segment of the joint to a similar system on the other segment. This posture can also be reported as M−1 = (RT, −RTt) by interchanging the role of the two segments. Several definitions of a Fre´chet mean for a random motion are proposed using weighted least squares distances. A special emphasis is given to a Fre´chet mean that is equivariant with respect to the inverse transform; this means that if P is the Fre´chet mean for M then P−1 is the Fre´chet mean for M−1, where M is a random SE( p) object. The sampling properties of moment estimators of the Fre´chet means are studied in a large concentration setting, where the scatter of the random Ms around their mean value P is small, and as the sample size goes to ∞. Some simple exponential family models for SE( p) data that generalize Downs’ (1972) Fisher–von Mises matrix distribution for rotation matrices are introduced and the least squares mean values for these distributions are calculated. Asymptotic comparisons between the estimators presented in this work are carried out for a particular model when p = 2. A numerical example involving the motion of the ankle is presented to illustrate the methodology.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether distinct subgroups with homogeneous running patterns can be identified among a large group of injured and healthy runners and whether identified subgroups are associated with specific injury location. Three-dimensional kinematic data from 291 injured and healthy runners, representing both sexes and a wide range of ages (1066 years) was clustered using hierarchical cluster analysis. Cluster analysis revealed five distinct subgroups from the data. Kinematic differences between the subgroups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Against our hypothesis, runners with the same injury types did not cluster together, but the distribution of different injuries within subgroups was similar across the entire sample. These results suggest that homogeneous gait patterns exist independent of injury location and that it is important to consider these underlying patterns when planning injury prevention or rehabilitation strategies.},

We show that such data exist and are mishandled by models that do not take into account the inherently recycling nature of some phenomenon. Clock and calendar effects are the obvious cases, but directional data are observed as well. We describe a standard maximum likelihood regression modeling framework based on the von Mises distribution, then develop a general Bayesian regression procedure for the first time, providing an easy-to-use Metropolis-Hastings sampler for this approach. Applications include a chronographic analysis of U.S. domestic terrorism and directional party preferences in a two-dimensional ideological space for German Bundestag elections. The results demonstrate the importance of circular models to handle periodic and directional data in political science.},

The ﬁrst application concerns planar kinematics in the presence of soft-tissue artefacts and the second application concerns rigid body kinematics in 3D with ﬁnite helical axes (FHA). The percentage of simulations in which BIK was more accurate than least-squares based methods was only high in cases of relatively large noise magnitudes (noise SD {\textgreater}5 mm) or when the rotation magnitude was very small (65 deg) in the 3D FHA model. Correlated parameters are the likely culprit of the low performance of BIK. Also computation time is a major deﬁcit of the BIK approach (Æ20 s for the movement between two time frames). These results indicate that more research will be necessary to improve the accuracy of BIK for complex biomechanical models at realistic noise levels and to reduce computation time.},

	abstract = {Inverse dynamics is a standard approach for estimating joint loadings in the lower extremity from kinematic and ground reaction data for use in clinical and research gait studies. Variability in estimating body segment parameters and uncertainty in defining anatomical landmarks have the potential to impact predicted joint loading. This study demonstrates the application of efficient probabilistic methods to quantify the effect of uncertainty in these parameters and landmarks on joint loading in an inverse-dynamics model, and identifies the relative importance of the parameters and landmarks to the predicted joint loading. The inverse-dynamics analysis used a benchmark data set of lower-extremity kinematics and ground reaction data during the stance phase of gait to predict the three-dimensional intersegmental forces and moments. The probabilistic analysis predicted the 1–99 percentile ranges of intersegmental forces and moments at the hip, knee, and ankle. Variabilities, in forces and moments of up to 56\% and 156\% of the mean values were predicted based on coefficients of variation less than 0.20 for the body segment parameters and standard deviations of 2mm for the anatomical landmarks. Sensitivity factors identified the important parameters for the specific joint and component directions. Anatomical landmarks affected moments to a larger extent than body segment parameters. Additionally, for forces, anatomical landmarks had a larger effect than body segment parameters, with the exception of segment masses, which were important to the proximal-distal joint forces. The probabilistic modeling approach predicted the range of possible joint loading, which has implications in gait studies, clinical assessments, and implant design evaluations.},

Unfortunately, differentiation amplifies the noise present to such an extent that additional signal treatment is essential. The study was conducted to compare film generated acceleration curves with the analog acceleration curves of single segment movements. An instrumented segment was manually manipulated by the hand to produce analog records of the angular displacement and acceleration of the segment. Simultaneous filming of the \&gment produced ipchro\&ed displaament data. Acceleration Unctions were determined from these data us\&g “finite difference,” “Chebyshev least squares polynomials” and “digital filtering followed by finite difference” techniques. Digital filtering combined with a first order finite difference technique produced acceleration data very closely approximating the analog signals. The other two techniaues were clearlv inferior.

	abstract = {Bayes [Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 53 (1763) 370–418; 54 296–325] introduced the observed likelihood function to statistical inference and provided a weight function to calibrate the parameter; he also introduced a conﬁdence distribution on the parameter space but did not provide present justiﬁcations. Of course the names likelihood and conﬁdence did not appear until much later: Fisher [Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 222 (1922) 309–368] for likelihood and Neyman [Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 237 (1937) 333–380] for conﬁdence. Lindley [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 20 (1958) 102–107] showed that the Bayes and the conﬁdence results were different when the model was not location. This paper examines the occurrence of true statements from the Bayes approach and from the conﬁdence approach, and shows that the proportion of true statements in the Bayes case depends critically on the presence of linearity in the model; and with departure from this linearity the Bayes approach can be a poor approximation and be seriously misleading. Bayesian integration of weighted likelihood thus provides a ﬁrst-order linear approximation to conﬁdence, but without linearity can give substantially incorrect results.},

Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious "momentum" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.},

The purpose of this article is to provide a perspective on how data science methods can be incorporated into our ﬁeld to advance our understanding of gait biomechanics and improve treatment planning procedures. We provide examples of how data science approaches have been applied to biomechanical data. We then discuss the challenges that remain for effectively using data science approaches in clinical gait analysis and gait biomechanics research, including the need for new tools, better infrastructure and incentives for sharing data, and education across the disciplines of biomechanics and data science. By addressing these challenges, we can revolutionize treatment planning and biomechanics research by capitalizing on the wealth of knowledge gained by gait researchers over the past decades and the vast, but often siloed, data that are collected in clinical and research laboratories around the world.},

	abstract = {The key operation in Bayesian inference is to compute high-dimensional integrals. An old approximate technique is the Laplace method or approximation, which dates back to Pierre-Simon Laplace (1774). This simple idea approximates the integrand with a second-order Taylor expansion around the mode and computes the integral analytically. By developing a nested version of this classical idea, combined with modern numerical techniques for sparse matrices, we obtain the approach of integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to do approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs). LGMs represent an important model abstraction for Bayesian inference and include a large proportion of the statistical models used today. In this review, we discuss the reasons for the success of the INLA approach, the R-INLA package, why it is so accurate, why the approximations are very quick to compute, and why LGMs make such a useful concept for Bayesian computing.},

	abstract = {Background/Aim: Three-dimensional kinematic measures of gait are routinely used in clinical gait analysis and provide a key outcome measure for gait research and clinical practice. This systematic review identiﬁes and evaluates current evidence for the inter-session and inter-assessor reliability of threedimensional kinematic gait analysis (3DGA) data.
Method: A targeted search strategy identiﬁed reports that fulﬁlled the search criteria. The quality of fulltext reports were tabulated and evaluated for quality using a customised critical appraisal tool.
Results: Fifteen full manuscripts and eight abstracts were included. Studies addressed both withinassessor and between-assessor reliability, with most examining healthy adults. Four full-text reports evaluated reliability in people with gait pathologies. The highest reliability indices occurred in the hip and knee in the sagittal plane, with lowest errors in pelvic rotation and obliquity and hip abduction. Lowest reliability and highest error frequently occurred in the hip and knee transverse plane. Methodological quality varied, with key limitations in sample descriptions and strategies for statistical analysis. Reported reliability indices and error magnitudes varied across gait variables and studies. Most studies providing estimates of data error reported values (S.D. or S.E.) of less than 58, with the exception of hip and knee rotation.
Conclusion: This review provides evidence that clinically acceptable errors are possible in gait analysis. Variability between studies, however, suggests that they are not always achieved. ß 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Perhaps the least studied approach is elimination of nuisance parameters through integration, in the sense that this is viewed as an almost incidental byproduct of Bayesian analysis and is hence not something which is deemed to require separate study. There is, however, considerable value in considering integrated likelihood on its own, especially versions arising from default or noninformative priors. In this paper, we review such common integrated likelihoods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses relative to other methods.},

We show how posterior inference for distributional features such as the angular mean direction and concentration can be implemented as well as how prediction within the regression setting can be handled. With regard to model comparison, we argue for an out-of-sample approach using both a predictive likelihood scoring loss criterion and a cumulative rank probability score criterion.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily ﬁtted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with ﬁtting these models, and demonstrate how to ﬁt HGAMs on example data.

A general class of models is proposed in which the mean direction and dispersion of a von Mises variate are related to the explanatory variables by general link functions. Appropriate regression diagnostics, estimation and testing procedures are developed for fitting the models. The meaning of "correlation" between an angular and a linear variable is clarified, and leads to a general notion of multiple correlation associated with the regression model.
